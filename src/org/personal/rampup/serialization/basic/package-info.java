	1. Normal Serialization and deserializaton 
	2. Serialization and deserializaton with multiple types of object
	3. Using Transient 
	4. Custom serialization and deserializaton for transient fields providing implementation for readObject and writeObject (defaultReadObject | defaultWriteObject)
	5. Using readResolve and writeReplace
	6. Serialization in inheritance Imp: if child implements serializable but parent not || INSTANCE CONTROL FLOW
	7. Usage of Externalizable and implementation along with writeReplace and readResolve and behaviour of transient in this case [transient doesnot matter at all in case of externalizable]
	8. Benefits for SerialVersionUID and why it is required.
	9. Behaviour of static, final and transient fields in Serrialization and Externalization.
